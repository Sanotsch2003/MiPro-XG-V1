PREG Output pipelining  
DSP CPU_Core_inst/ALU_inst/p_1_out output CPU_Core_inst/ALU_inst/p_1_out/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 ram_inst/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin ram_inst/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: ram_inst/ADDRARDADDR[8]) which is driven by a register (CPU_Core_inst/ALU_inst/resultReg_reg[10]_rep) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
